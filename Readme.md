m1 has a zip cracker *(script2.py)* that directly shows the final output with number of passwords tested. requires user to input path directly in code.
the other piece of code *(script3.py)* asks the user to input the paths for both the passwords.txt and the zip file while giving output with each password being tested and the correct one.
